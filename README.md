Some famous algorithms in c++.

Here, in this following repisotory we are going to see some different algorithms well known in the world of computer science and oftenlly used in schools, and even it might be useful also on your professionnal career.

## RecursionSubTableSum
It's an algorithm which does a sum recursionly on tables(where we can choose if it is a full table sum or a sub table sum).

## Factorial
It's a well known algorithm in the world, which we know that it's purpose is to calculate a factorial, in this algorithme that I made, it's not iterative factorial but a recursion one.

## Fibonnacci
It's a famous algorithm which is related to the great mathematician Fibonacci, in this algorithm we are going to calculate the fibonnacci sum of a number, and it's a recursion algorithm.

## Power
It's a famous algorithm for computer science students that is usually asked by teachers, and it's a recursion algorithm.

## Armstrong Number
It's a famous algorithm where a number that is the sum of its own digits each raised to the power of the number of digits, in this algorithm we are working on base 10.

## Second Degre Solver
It's a well known algorithm, really used and studied by pupils in the middle school and even in high school, and also studied
by licence's degree students in comptuer science and other courses.
