Some famous algorithms in c++.

Here, in this following repisotory we are going to see some different algorithms well known in the world of computer science and oftenlly used in schools, and even it might be useful also on your professionnal career.

## RecursionSubTableSum
It's an algorithm which does a sum recursionly on tables(where we can choose if it is a full table sum or a sub table sum).

## Factorial
It's a well known algorithm in the world, which we know that it's purpose is to calculate a factorial, in this algorithme that I made, it's not iterative factorial but a recursion one.
